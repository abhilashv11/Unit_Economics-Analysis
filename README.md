# Unit Economics & Margin Optimization Command Center

## 🚩 Problem Statement
Top-line revenue growth was masking a significant **$110K annual net loss**. Siloed data prevented visibility into high-volume products, such as Gaming Laptops, which acted as "Value Destroyers" once COGS and shipping overhead were integrated.

## 🛠️ Solution Approach
I architected a cross-functional pipeline joining **MySQL** transactions with live **Google Sheets** budgets. This shifted reporting from gross sales to **Net Contribution Margin**, utilizing a **DAX-powered simulation layer** for real-time price modeling and profit recovery.

## 🧰 Tech Stack
* **Database:** MySQL
* **Visualization:** Power BI (DAX)
* **Programming:** Python (Pandas)
* **Integration:** Google Sheets API

## 📈 Project Highlights
* **Data Modeling:** Designed a relational schema to aggregate transactional data and marketing spend into a single ”Source of Truth” for profitability.
* **Margin Analysis:** Built SQL views to calculate **Contribution Margin 1 & 2**, isolating the impact of shipping and CAC on unit-level profit.
* **Executive Dashboarding:** Created a ”Bleeding Alert” dashboard in Power BI to prioritize loss-making categories for immediate management review.
* **Scenario Modeling:** Authored a DAX-powered ”What-If” parameter to simulate price adjustments, demonstrating a pivot from loss to **$74K profit** in key categories.
* **Business Impact:** Provided a data-backed roadmap projecting a total profit recovery of **$180K+** across Electronics and Furniture categories.
